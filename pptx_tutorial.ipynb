    "\n",
    "###Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root of the Graph**:\n",
    "   - The `Presentation` object is the root node. From here, you can traverse and manipulate all components of the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Traversing the Graph**:\n",
    "   - You access child objects (e.g., slides) through properties of the `Presentation` object.\n",
    "   - You access further child objects (e.g., shapes) through properties of the slide objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adding Objects to the Graph**:\n",
    "   - New objects (e.g., slides, shapes) are added by calling methods on their container objects. For example, you add a slide by calling a method on the `Presentation` object, and you add a shape by calling a method on a `Slide` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's illustrate these concepts with an example where we create a new presentation, add a slide, and then add shapes to that slide.\n",

    "from pptx.util import Inches\n",
    "\n",

    "prs = Presentation()\n",

    "# Save the presentation\n",
    "prs.save('example_presentation.pptx')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating the Presentation**:\n",
    "   - `prs = Presentation()`: This creates a new `Presentation` object, which is the root of the object graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding a Slide**:\n",
    "   - `slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[5]`: Select a slide layout.\n",
    "   - `slide = prs.slides.add_slide(slide_layout)`: Adds a new slide to the presentation. The slide is a child of the `Presentation` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Adding a Title Shape**:\n",
    "   - `title_shape = slide.shapes.title`: Accesses the title placeholder shape of the slide.\n",
    "   - `title_shape.text = \"Hello, Python-pptx!\"`: Sets the text of the title shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adding a Textbox Shape**:\n",
    "   - `textbox = slide.shapes.add_textbox(left, top, width, height)`: Adds a textbox to the slide at the specified position and size. The textbox is a child of the slide.\n",
    "   - `textbox.text = \"This is a sample textbox.\"`: Sets the text of the textbox.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Adding a Picture Shape**:\n",
    "   - `pic = slide.shapes.add_picture(img_path, left, top)`: Adds a picture to the slide at the specified position. The picture is a child of the slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Saving the Presentation**:\n",
    "   - `prs.save('example_presentation.pptx')`: Saves the presentation to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Traversing the Graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we traverse the graph as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start with the `Presentation` object (`prs`).\n",
    "- Access the `slides` property of the `Presentation` object to get a collection of slides.\n",
    "- Access the `shapes` property of a `Slide` object to get a collection of shapes on that slide.\n",
    "- Add new shapes (textbox, picture) by calling methods on the `shapes` collection of the slide.\n",
    "\n",
    "By working in this way, you interact with the presentation structure in an organized and hierarchical manner, without directly constructing objects for slides or shapes. Instead, you use the appropriate properties and methods provided by the `Presentation` object and its children.\n",
    "\n",

    "The documentation snippet for the `Presentation` class from the `python-pptx` library provides important details about how to work with this class. Here’s a breakdown and explanation of the key points:\n",
    "\n",
    "###Key Points from the Documentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class Name and Location**:\n",
    "   - `class pptx.presentation.Presentation`: Indicates that the `Presentation` class is located in the `pptx.presentation` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Description**:\n",
    "   - `PresentationML (PML) presentation`: Specifies that the `Presentation` class represents a PresentationML (PML) presentation. PresentationML is the XML-based format used by PowerPoint to represent a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Instantiation**:\n",
    "   - `Not intended to be constructed directly. Use pptx.Presentation() to open or create a presentation.`: This means you should not create instances of the `Presentation` class using the class constructor directly. Instead, you should use the `pptx.Presentation()` function provided by the `python-pptx` library to create or open a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Explanation with Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "####Correct Way to Create or Open a Presentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "You should use the `pptx.Presentation()` function to create a new presentation or open an existing one. This function returns an instance of the `Presentation` class, which is the main object you will interact with to manipulate the PowerPoint presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how you do it:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Creating a New Presentation**:\n",
    "   - When you call `pptx.Presentation()` without any arguments, it creates a new, empty presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pptx import Presentation\n",
    "# Create a new, empty presentation\n",
    "prs = Presentation()\n",
    "prs.save('new_presentation.pptx')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Opening an Existing Presentation**:\n",
    "   - When you call `pptx.Presentation('file_path')` with the path to an existing PowerPoint file, it opens that file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pptx import Presentation\n",
    "# Open an existing presentation\n",
    "prs = Presentation('existing_presentation.pptx')\n",
    "# Access the first slide\n",
    "slide = prs.slides[0]\n",
    "# Print the title of the first slide\n",
    "title = slide.shapes.title\n",
    "print(title.text)\n",
    "# Save any changes to the presentation\n",
    "prs.save('modified_presentation.pptx')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###Why Not Construct Directly?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason you should not construct the `Presentation` object directly (e.g., `prs = Presentation()`) is because the `pptx.Presentation()` function handles the necessary setup and configuration to correctly initialize a new or existing presentation. This includes setting up the underlying XML structure for a new presentation or correctly parsing an existing presentation file. Direct construction would bypass these important steps, potentially leading to incorrect or incomplete initialization of the presentation object.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `pptx.Presentation()` function, you ensure that the `Presentation` object is properly set up, making it ready for you to work with slides, shapes, text, and other elements of the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Class**: `pptx.presentation.Presentation`\n",
    "- **Description**: Represents a PresentationML (PML) presentation.\n",
    "- **Instantiation**: Use `pptx.Presentation()` to create or open a presentation, rather than directly instantiating the `Presentation` class.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Ensures proper initialization and setup of the presentation object, whether creating a new one or opening an existing file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `pptx.Presentation()` function is the correct and intended way to work with PowerPoint presentations in the `python-pptx` library.\n",

    "- The `core_properties` attribute is an instance of `CoreProperties`, allowing you to set and get metadata properties like `title`, `author`, `subject`, and `keywords`.\n",

When you print an object directly, such as a `SlideMaster` object, Python's default string representation of the object includes the memory address in hexadecimal format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a detailed breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Direct Object Representation**: When you print an object directly, e.g., `<pptx.slide.SlideMaster object at 0x1e5131b8e50>`, Python uses the `__repr__` method of the object to give a string that includes the type and memory address of the object. The address is shown in hexadecimal format (`0x1e5131b8e50`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Using `id()`**: When you use `id(obj)`, it returns the memory address (or unique identifier) of the object in decimal format. For example, if `id(obj)` returns `2083379508704`, it means the memory address in decimal format is `2083379508704`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert between these formats:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hexadecimal to Decimal**:\n",
    "  - `0x1e5131b8e50` is the hexadecimal representation.\n",
    "  - To convert it to decimal: `int('1e5131b8e50', 16)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decimal to Hexadecimal**:\n",
    "  - `2083379508704` is the decimal representation.\n",
    "  - To convert it to hexadecimal: `hex(2083379508704)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can verify this with a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "obj = prs.slide_masters[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Direct representation\n",
    "print(obj)  # e.g., <pptx.slide.SlideMaster object at 0x1e5131b8e50>\n",

    "print(hex(obj_id))  # e.g., 0x1e5131b8e50\n",
    "```\n",

    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    Return a newly added slide that inherits layout from *slide_layout*.\n",

    "    return slide\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Method Signature and Docstring**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   def add_slide(self, slide_layout):\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "       Return a newly added slide that inherits layout from *slide_layout*.\n",
    "       \"\"\"\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Method Signature**: The method is defined to take two parameters, `self` (which refers to the instance of the `Slides` class) and `slide_layout` (which specifies the layout to be used for the new slide).\n",
    "   - **Docstring**: A brief description of what the method does: it returns a newly added slide that inherits its layout from `slide_layout`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Adding the Slide**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   rId, slide = self.part.add_slide(slide_layout)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **Call to `self.part.add_slide(slide_layout)`**: This method call is likely made to the `PresentationPart` object associated with the `Slides` collection. It adds a new slide with the specified layout.\n",
    "   - **Return Values**: This method returns two values: `rId` (the relationship ID of the new slide) and `slide` (the newly created slide object).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Cloning Layout Placeholders**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   slide.shapes.clone_layout_placeholders(slide_layout)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`slide.shapes`**: Accesses the `shapes` collection of the newly created slide.\n",
    "   - **`clone_layout_placeholders(slide_layout)`**: This method clones the placeholders (e.g., title, content boxes) from the specified `slide_layout` to the new slide. This ensures that the new slide has the same placeholders as the layout it is based on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Adding Slide ID**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   self._sldIdLst.add_sldId(rId)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`self._sldIdLst`**: This is the internal list that keeps track of the slide IDs in the presentation.\n",
    "   - **`add_sldId(rId)`**: Adds the relationship ID (`rId`) of the new slide to this list. This step is essential for maintaining the internal structure and references within the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Returning the New Slide**:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   return slide\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The method returns the newly created slide object.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Putting It All Together\n",
    "\n",
    "The `add_slide` method does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calls a method on the `PresentationPart` object to add a new slide with the specified layout.\n",
    "2. Clones the layout placeholders from the specified layout to the new slide, ensuring that the new slide has the same layout structure.\n",
    "3. Adds the relationship ID of the new slide to the internal list of slide IDs.\n",
    "4. Returns the newly created slide object.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Example Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you might use this method in practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pptx import Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new presentation\n",
    "prs = Presentation()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choose a slide layout (e.g., Title Slide)\n",
    "slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a new slide with the chosen layout\n",
    "new_slide = prs.slides.add_slide(slide_layout)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the title text for the new slide\n",
    "title_shape = new_slide.shapes.title\n",
    "title_shape.text = \"New Slide Title\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the presentation\n",
    "prs.save('example_presentation.pptx')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create a new presentation, choose a slide layout, add a new slide with that layout, set the title text for the new slide, and save the presentation. The `add_slide` method is responsible for creating the new slide and ensuring it inherits the specified layout.\n",

    "can you please explain what is part here. what do you mean by collection here. what is PresentationPart object. to explain you can refer the open source code present at github https://github.com/scanny/python-pptx\n",
    "\n",
    "Certainly! Let's delve deeper into the concepts of `part`, `collection`, and `PresentationPart` in the context of `python-pptx`.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Understanding `part`, `collection`, and `PresentationPart`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`part`**:\n",
    "   - In `python-pptx`, the `part` attribute typically refers to an instance of a `Part` object that represents a part of the presentation package (an Open XML package). In the case of slides, `part` refers to the `PresentationPart` object, which is responsible for managing the slides and their relationships within the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collection**:\n",
    "   - A collection in `python-pptx` is an object that groups together multiple related objects and provides methods to interact with them. For example, the `Slides` object is a collection that groups together all the slides in a presentation. It provides methods to add, remove, and access individual slides.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`PresentationPart`**:\n",
    "   - `PresentationPart` is a class in `python-pptx` that represents the main part of the PowerPoint presentation. It contains references to all slides, slide layouts, slide masters, and other components that make up the presentation. The `add_slide` method in `PresentationPart` is responsible for adding a new slide to the presentation and setting up its relationships and content.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Source Code Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand these concepts better, let's look at some relevant parts of the `python-pptx` source code from its GitHub repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Slides` Class**:\n",
    "   - The `Slides` class is found in `pptx/slide.py`. It manages the collection of slides in a presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class Slides(ParentedElementProxy):\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "       def add_slide(self, slide_layout):\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "           Return a newly added slide that inherits layout from *slide_layout*.\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "           rId, slide = self.part.add_slide(slide_layout)\n",
    "           slide.shapes.clone_layout_placeholders(slide_layout)\n",
    "           self._sldIdLst.add_sldId(rId)\n",
    "           return slide\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`PresentationPart` Class**:\n",
    "   - The `PresentationPart` class is found in `pptx/parts/presentation.py`. It represents the main part of the presentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   class PresentationPart(BasePart):\n",
    "       ...\n",
    "       def add_slide(self, slide_layout):\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "           Return (rId, slide) pair for newly added slide that inherits layout\n",
    "           from *slide_layout*.\n",
    "           \"\"\"\n",
    "           slide = Slide.new(self, slide_layout)\n",
    "           self._sldIdLst.append(slide)\n",
    "           rId = self.relate_to(slide, RT.SLIDE)\n",
    "           return rId, slide\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "###Detailed Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`Slides` Class**:\n",
    "   - **Inheritance**: The `Slides` class inherits from `ParentedElementProxy`, which means it acts as a proxy to its parent element (in this case, the `Presentation` object).\n",
    "   - **add_slide Method**: This method calls `self.part.add_slide(slide_layout)`. Here, `self.part` refers to the `PresentationPart` object associated with the `Slides` collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`PresentationPart` Class**:\n",
    "   - **add_slide Method**: This method creates a new slide (`Slide.new(self, slide_layout)`) and sets up its relationships. It returns a tuple `(rId, slide)`, where `rId` is the relationship ID and `slide` is the newly created slide object.\n",
    "\n",
    "###Example in Context\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a complete example that ties everything together:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from pptx import Presentation\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create a new presentation\n",
    "prs = Presentation()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Choose a slide layout (e.g., Title Slide)\n",
    "slide_layout = prs.slide_layouts[0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Add a new slide with the chosen layout\n",
    "new_slide = prs.slides.add_slide(slide_layout)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the title text for the new slide\n",
    "title_shape = new_slide.shapes.title\n",
    "title_shape.text = \"New Slide Title\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Save the presentation\n",
    "prs.save('example_presentation.pptx')\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "- **`part`**: Refers to the `PresentationPart` object associated with the `Slides` collection, managing the main part of the presentation.\n",
    "- **Collection**: The `Slides` class acts as a collection, grouping together all slides and providing methods to interact with them.\n",
