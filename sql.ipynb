    "In SQL, when you use a comma between two tables in the `FROM` clause, it is creating a Cartesian product (cross join) between those tables. This means that every row from the first table is paired with every row from the second table. In your query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "select customer_name, count(*) as no_of_orders\n",
    "from orders, cte\n",
    "group by customer_name\n",

    "The `orders` table and the common table expression (CTE) `cte` are combined using a cross join. Since `cte` is expected to return only one row (it contains an aggregate calculation), the result is effectively adding the `avg_orders` value to every row from the `orders` table. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the query:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The CTE `cte` is defined, which calculates the average number of orders per customer:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   with cte as \n",
    "   (select count(*)/count(distinct(customer_name)) as avg_orders from orders)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. The main query:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   select customer_name, count(*) as no_of_orders\n",
    "   from orders, cte\n",
    "   group by customer_name\n",
    "   having count(*) > cte.avg_orders\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - `from orders, cte`: This creates a Cartesian product of `orders` and the single row from `cte`. Because `cte` returns a single row, each row of `orders` is effectively augmented with the `avg_orders` value.\n",
    "   - `group by customer_name`: This groups the result by `customer_name`.\n",
    "   - `having count(*) > cte.avg_orders`: This filters the groups to only include customers whose number of orders is greater than the average number of orders per customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, while a join is not explicitly specified, the cross join ensures that each row of `orders` has access to the `avg_orders` value from the CTE. This allows the `having` clause to compare the count of orders for each customer against this average.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the CTE were to return more than one row, this query would not work correctly because the Cartesian product would multiply the rows from `orders` by the number of rows in the CTE, leading to incorrect results. In this case, since the CTE is designed to return exactly one row, the query functions as intended."
